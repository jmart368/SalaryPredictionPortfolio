# Salary Prediction Project

**Purpose**
------------------------
Perhaps one of the most important factors in hiring and job retention is an employee's salary. Companies that compete within the same sector should always have an indicator of how much they should compensate their own job openings. This in return allows them to retain their employees and compete for talent whithin the same industry. This project aims to examine a set of job postings with their corresponding salaries and predict salaries for a new set of job postings.
