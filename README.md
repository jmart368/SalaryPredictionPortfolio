**Purpose**
------------------------
Perhaps one of the most important factors in hiring and job retention is an employee's salary. Companies that compete within the same sector should always have an indicator of how much they should compensate their own job openings. This in return allows them to retain their employees and compete for talent whithin the same industry. This project aims to examine a set of job postings with their corresponding salaries and predict salaries for a new set of job postings.

**Datasets**
------------------------
We are given the following data sets:

* **train_features.csv** - This file represents a total of 1,000,000 rows with 8 columns (header not included) where each row examines a unique job id along with list of attributes relating to that unique job id.

* **train_salaries.csv** - This file represent a total of 1,000,000 rows with 2 columns (header not included) where each row represents a unique job id along with its corresponfing salary. This file along with train_features.csv will be used for machine learning models.  

* **test_features.csv** - Identical to train_features.csv, where each row examines a unique job id along with list of attributes relating to that unique job. This file will be used to predict salaries
